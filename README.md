This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting bank customer churn. Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers stop doing business with a company—in this case, leaving their bank. The model aims to identify potential churners so that the bank can take proactive measures to retain them.

Introduction :-
Customer churn is a critical issue in the banking industry. This project provides a predictive model that can help banks identify customers who are likely to churn. By identifying potential churners early, the bank can take targeted actions to retain these customers, thereby improving customer retention rates.

Dataset :-
The dataset used for this project can be found in the data directory. It includes historical customer data with features such as customer age, account balance, transaction history, and more. The target variable is Churn, which indicates whether a customer has churned (1) or not (0).

Dependencies :-
To run the code in this repository, you will need the following dependencies: Python 3.x Google colab Jupyter Notebook (optional but recommended for exploring the code) Pandas NumPy Scikit-Learn Matplotlib (for data visualization) Seaborn (for data visualization)

Model Training :-
The model training process is documented in the Jupyter Notebook Bank_Churn_Prediction.ipynb. It covers data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and SMOTE.

Model Evaluation :-
We evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The evaluation results are discussed in the Google Colab.

Results :-
The results of the churn prediction model can be summarized here. You can also include visualizations and insights gained from the analysis.

Contributing :-
Contributions to this project are welcome! If you have suggestions or improvements, please open an issue or submit a pull request. For major changes, please discuss them in advance.
